UI-ROUTER-Servlet: 

   for ui page requests we need a servlet to capture them forward, as backend resteservlet is used to receive only
                   rest calls from UI or some other system.
                   
web.xml - 

<servlet>
<servlet-name> UIROUTERServlet </servlet-name>
<servlet-class> com.dummy.UIServletClass</servlet-class>
</servlet>

<servlet-mapping>
<servlet-name> UIROUTERServlet </servlet-name>
<servlet-pattern> /something/*</servlet-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>

public class UIRouterServlet extends HttpServlet {

 public void service ( httpservletreq req,httpservletres res) {
   getServletContent().getRequestDispatcher("/").forward(req, res);
 }
 
}

consumes Types:

we can write multiple consumes types with comma seperated!

Receive files in REST:

we can use  @RequestParam("file")MultipartFile file as parameter to receive files which were sent as multipart from UI.
here the name in UI is set as file.
consumes can also be ALL_VALUES, based on requirement.

Send files in REST:

use ResponseEntity<OctetStream> as return for downloading csv or any other files.
