spring:

load properties with spring: (these are not only spring related but also other general properties that might be used in application)

@PropertySource({"file:app.properties","file:sys.properties"})

now to read a property we use  @Value("${propName}") private String value;

EventHandler and Listeners Spring:

this is a good feature,
@EnableAsync will enable async event handling with spring and dispatches multiple threads or new thread where ever its required.
@EventListener(condition="#something"=='something') and this will listen to events which are published using spring
publisher.publishEvent()

aop:

spring has aop with @pointcut  and @Aspect .
but we can also use AspectJ from eclipse compile time aspectJ, we good to be used whenever required.

@transactional is used for transcations which opens and closes session and commit sql around method calls and also rollbacks in case of excetions
is a good example of aspect oriented programming.
